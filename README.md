A set of technical and software based on the use of electronics and designed for automatic 
or automated data processing in the process of solving computational and information tasks.

The first principles of construction and functioning of computers were formulated by the American scientist John von Neumann in 1945.
In accordance with these principles the computer must include: 
    arithmetic logic unit (ALU - Arithmetic and Logic Unit), 
    performing arithmetic and logical operations, 
    control unit, 
    designed to organize the execution of programs, 
    memory devices ( ZU );
